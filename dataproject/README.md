# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Coronavirus mentions in The Guardian** and is an analysis of data from the British newspaper *The Guardian* and *Johns Hopkins University*. We collected every article that mentions the Coronavirus from *The Guardian* using their API and we then cleaned and structured the data in order to present it in a graph. Furthermore, we collected data from *John Hopkins University* over the confirmed daily cases of Coronavirus in the top 10 most affected countries, which we also present in a graph. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [Handin_DataProject.ipynb](Handin_DataProject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets**:

1. INDKP101.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/INDKP101
1. RAS200.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/RAS200

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
